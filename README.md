# :dizzy: Dataset

## :dizzy: Overview
*TODO*: Explain about the data you are using and where you got it from.

## :dizzy: Task
*TODO*: Explain the task you are going to be solving with this dataset and the features you will be using for it.

## :dizzy: Access
*TODO*: Explain how you are accessing the data in your workspace.

# :dizzy: Automated ML
*TODO*: Give an overview of the `automl` settings and configuration you used for this experiment

### Results
*TODO*: What are the results you got with your automated ML model? What were the parameters of the model? How could you have improved it?

*TODO* Remeber to provide screenshots of the `RunDetails` widget as well as a screenshot of the best model trained with it's parameters.

# :dizzy: Hyperparameter Tuning
*TODO*: What kind of model did you choose for this experiment and why? Give an overview of the types of parameters and their ranges used for the hyperparameter search


### Results
*TODO*: What are the results you got with your model? What were the parameters of the model? How could you have improved it?

*TODO* Remeber to provide screenshots of the `RunDetails` widget as well as a screenshot of the best model trained with it's parameters.

# :dizzy: Model Deployment
*TODO*: Give an overview of the deployed model and instructions on how to query the endpoint with a sample input.

# :dizzy: Screen Recording
*TODO* Provide a link to a screen recording of the project in action. Remember that the screencast should demonstrate:
- A working model
- Demo of the deployed  model
- Demo of a sample request sent to the endpoint and its response

# :dizzy: Standout Suggestions
*TODO (Optional):* This is where you can provide information about any standout suggestions that you have attempted.
